# DocGen - A simple Document Generator

---

- **What is DocGen**

  DocGen is an android app developed using `Flutter` framework and `Dart` language. This tool generates valid brazilian documents, using the mathematical rules the government uses to validate these same documents. It also allows you to copy they generated number to your phone clipboard.
  
  The documents so far are:
  
  CPF - Individual Register
  RG - General record
  CNPJ - National Legal Entity Register (Company's ID)
  
  This app does not query a database, therefore, although the generated documents are indeed valid, they do not necessarily belong to a person nor are in a government database.
